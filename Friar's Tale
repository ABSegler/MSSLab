    Whilom ther was dwellynge in my contree

And erchedeken, a man of heigh degree,

That boldely dide execucioun

In punysshynge of fornicacioun,

Of wicchecraft, and eek of bawderye,

Of diffamacioun, and avowtrye,

Of chirche reves, and of testamentz,

Of contractes and of lakke of sacramentz,

Of usure, and of symonye also.

But certes, lecchours dide he grettest wo;

They sholde syngen if that they were hent;

And smale tytheres weren foule yshent,

If any persoun wolde upon hem pleyne.

Ther myghte asterte hym no pecunyal peyne.

For smale tithes and for smal offrynge

He made the peple pitously to synge.

For er the bisshop caughte hem with his hook,

They weren in the erchedeknes book.

Thanne hadde he, thurgh his jurisdiccioun,

Power to doon on hem correccioun.

He hadde a somonour redy to his hond;

A slyer boye nas noon in Engelond;

For subtilly he hadde his espiaille,

That taughte hym wel wher that hym myghte availle.

He koude spare of lecchours oon or two,

To techen hym to foure and twenty mo.

For thogh this somonour wood were as an hare,

To telle his harlotrye I wol nat spare;

For we been out of his correccioun.

They han of us no jurisdiccioun,

Ne nevere shullen, terme of alle hir lyves.

       "Peter! so been the wommen of the styves,"

Quod the Somonour, "yput out of oure cure!"
70
       "Pees! with myschance and with mysaventure!"

Thys seyde oure Hoost, "and lat hym telle his tale.

Now telleth forth, thogh that the somonour gale;

Ne spareth nat, myn owene maister deere."

       This false theef, this somonour, quod the Frere,
75
Hadde alwey bawdes redy to his hond,

As any hauk to lure in Engelond,

That tolde hym al the secree that they knewe;

For hire acqueyntace was nat come of newe.

They weren his approwours prively.
80
He took hymself a greet profit therby;

His maister knew nat alwey what he wan.

Withouten mandement a lewed man

He koude somne, on peyne of Cristes curs,

And they were glade for to fille his purs,
85
And make hym grete feestes atte nale.

And right as Judas hadde purses smale,

And was a theef, right swich a theef was he;

His maister hadde but half his duetee.

He was, if I shal yeven hym his laude,
90
A theef, and eek a somnour, and baude.

He hadde eek wenches at his retenue,

That, wheither that sir Robert or sir Huwe,

Or Jakke, or Rauf, or whoso that it were

That lay by hem, they tolde it in his ere.
95
Thus was the wenche and he of oon assent;

And he wolde fecche a feyned mandement,

And somne hem to chapitre bothe two,

And pile the man, and lete the wenche go.

Thanne wolde he seye, 'Freend, I shal for thy sake
100
Do striken hire out of oure lettres blake;

Thee thar namoore as in this cas travaille.

I am thy freend, ther I thee may availle.'

Certeyn he knew of briberyes mo

Than possible is to telle in yeres two.
105
For in this world nys dogge for the bowe

That kan an hurt deer from an hool yknowe

Bet than this somnour knew a sly lecchour,

Or an avowtier, or a paramour.

And for that was the fruyt of al his rente,
110
Therfore on it he sette al his entente.

And so bifel that ones on a day

This somnour, evere waityng on his pray,

Rood for to somne an old wydwe, a ribibe,

Feynynge a cause, for he wolde brybe.
115
And happed that he saugh bifore hym ryde

A gay yeman, under a forest syde,

A bowe he bar, and arwes brighte and kene;

He hadde upon a courtepy of grene,

An hat upon his heed with frenges blake.
120
       "Sire," quod this somnour, "hayl, and wel atake!"

       "Welcome," quod he, "and every good felawe!

Wher rydestow, under this grene-wode shawe?"

Seyde this yeman, "Wiltow fer to day?"

       This somnour hym answerde and seyde, "Nay;
125
Heere faste by," quod he, "is myn entente

To ryden, for to reysen up a rente

That longeth to my lordes duetee."

       "Artow thanne a bailly?" "Ye," quod he.

He dorste nat, for verray filthe and shame
130
Seye that he was a somonour, for the name.

       "Depardieux," quod this yeman, "deere broother,

Thou art a bailly, and I am another.

I am unknowen as in this contree;

Of thyn aqueyntance I wolde praye thee,
135
And eek of bretherhede, if that yow leste.

I have gold and silver in my cheste;

If that thee happe to comen in oure shire,

Al shal be thyn, right as thou wolt desire."

       "Grant mercy," quod this somonour, "by my feith!"
140
Everych in ootheres hand his trouthe leith,

For to be sworne bretheren til they deye.

In daliance they ryden forth and pleye.

       This somonour, which that was as ful of jangles,

As ful of venym been thise waryangles,
145
And evere enqueryng upon every thyng,

       "Brother," quod he, "where is now youre dwellyng

Another day if that I sholde yow seche?"

This yeman hym answerde in softe speche,

       "Brother," quod he, "fer in the north contree,
150
Where-as I hope som tyme I shal thee see.

Er we departe, I shal thee so wel wisse

That of myn hous ne shaltow nevere mysse."

       "Now, brother," quod this somonour, "I yow preye,

Teche me, whil that we ryden by the weye,
155
Syn that ye been a baillif as am I,

Som subtiltee, and tel me feithfully

In myn office how that I may moost wynne;

And spareth nat for conscience ne synne,

But as my brother tel me, how do ye."
160
       "Now, by my trouthe, brother deere," seyde he,

"As I shal tellen thee a feithful tale,

My wages been ful streite and ful smale.

My lord is hard to me and daungerous,

And myn office is ful laborous,
165
And therfore by extorcions I lyve.

For sothe, I take al that men wol me yive.

Algate, by sleyghte or by violence,

Fro yeer to yeer I wynne al my dispence.

I kan no bettre telle, feithfully."
170
       "Now certes," quod this somonour, "so fare I.

I spare nat to taken, God it woot,

But if it be to hevy or to hoot.

What I may gete in conseil prively,

No maner conscience of that have I.
175
Nere myn extorcioun, I myghte nat lyven,

Ne of swiche japes wol I nat be shryven.

Stomak ne conscience ne knowe I noon;

I shrewe thise shrifte-fadres everychoon.

Wel be we met, by God and by Seint Jame!
180
But, leeve brother, tel me thanne thy name,"

Quod this somonour. In this meene while

This yeman gan a litel for to smyle.

       "Brother," quod he, "wiltow that I thee telle?

I am a feend; my dwellyng is in helle,
185
And heere I ryde aboute my purchasyng,

To wite wher men wol yeve me any thyng.

My purchas is th'effect of al my rente.

Looke how thou rydest for the same entente,

To wynne good, thou rekkest nevere how;
190
Right so fare I, for ryde wolde I now

Unto the worldes ende for a preye."

       "A!" quod this somonour, "benedicite! sey ye?

I wende ye were a yeman trewely.

Ye han a mannes shap as wel as I;
195
Han ye a figure thanne determinat

In helle, ther ye been in youre estat?"

       "Nay, certeinly," quod he, "ther have we noon;

But whan us liketh, we kan take us oon,

Or elles make yow seme we been shape
200
Somtyme lyk a man, or lyk an ape,

Or lyk an angel kan I ryde or go.

It is no wonder thyng thogh it be so;

A lowsy jogelour kan deceyve thee,

And pardee, yet kan I moore craft than he."
205
       "Why," quod this somonour, "ryde ye thanne or goon

In sondry shap, and nat alwey in oon?"

       "For we," quod he, "wol us swiche formes make

As moost able is oure preyes for to take."

       "What maketh yow to han al this labour?"
210
       "Ful many a cause, leeve sire somonour,"

Seyde this feend, "but alle thyng hath tyme.

The day is short, and it is passed pryme,

And yet ne wan I nothyng in this day.

I wol entende to wynnyng, if I may,
215
And nat entende oure wittes to declare.

For, brother myn, thy wit is al to bare

To understonde, althogh I tolde hem thee.

But, for thou axest why labouren we -

For somtyme we been goddes instrumentz,
220
And meenes to doon his comandementz,

Whan that hym list, upon his creatures,

In divers art and in diverse figures.

Withouten hym we have no myght, certayn,

If that hym list stonden ther-agayn.
225
And somtyme, at oure prayere, han we leve

Oonly the body and nat the soule greve;

Witnesse on job, whom that we diden wo.

And somtyme han we myght of bothe two,

This is to seyn, of soule and body eke.
230
And somtyme be we suffred for to seke

Upon a man, and doon his soule unreste,

And nat his body, and al is for the beste.

Whan he withstandeth oure temptacioun,

It is a cause of his savacioun,
235
Al be it that it was nat oure entente

He sholde be sauf, but that we wolde hym hente.

And somtyme be we servant unto man,

As to the erchebisshop Seint Dunstan,

And to the apostles servent eek was I."
240
       "Yet tel me," quod the somonour, "feithfully,

Make ye yow newe bodies thus alway

Of elementz?" The feend answerde, "Nay.

Somtyme we feyne, and somtyme we aryse

With dede bodyes, in ful sondry wyse,
245
And speke as renably and faire and wel

As to the Phitonissa dide Samuel.

(And yet wol som men seye it was nat he;

I do no fors of youre dyvynytee.)

But o thyng warne I thee, I wol nat jape, -
250
Thou wolt algates wite how we been shape;

Thou shalt herafterward, my brother deere,

Come there thee nedeth nat of me to leere.

For thou shalt, by thyn owene experience,

Konne in a chayer rede of this sentence
255
Bet than Virgile, while he was on lyve,

Or dant also. Now lat us ryde blyve,

For I wole holde compaignye with thee

Til it be so that thou forsake me."

       "Nay," quod this somonour, "that shal nat bityde!
260
I am a yeman, knowen is ful wyde;

My trouthe wol I holde, as in this cas.

For though thou were the devel Sathanas,

My trouthe wol I holde to my brother,

As I am sworn, and ech of us til oother,
265
For to be trewe brother in this cas;

And bothe we goon abouten oure purchas.

Taak thou thy part, what that men wol thee yive,

And I shal myn; thus may we bothe lyve.

And if that any of us have moore than oother,
270
Lat hym be trewe, and parte it with his brother."

       "I graunte," quod the devel, "by my fey.

And with that word they ryden forth hir wey.

And right at the entryng of the townes ende,

To which this somonour shoop hym for to wende,
275
They saugh a cart that charged was with hey,

Which that a cartere droof forth in his wey.

Deep was the wey, for which the carte stood.

The cartere smoot, and cryde as he were wood,

"Hayt, Brok! Hayt, Scot! what spare ye for the stones?
280
The feend," quod he, "yow fecche, body and bones,

As ferforthly as evere were ye foled,

So muche wo as I have with yow tholed!

The devel have al, bothe hors and cart and hey!"

       This somonour seyde, "Heere shal we have a pley."
285
And neer the feend he drough, as noght ne were,

Ful prively, and rowned in his ere:

"Herkne, my brother, herkne, by thy feith!

Herestow nat how that the cartere seith?

Hent it anon, for he hath yeve it thee,
290
Bothe hey and cart, and eek his caples thre."

       "Nay," quod the devel, "God woot, never a deel!

It is nat his entente, trust me weel.

Axe hym thyself, it thou nat trowest me;

Or elles stynt a while, and thou shalt see."
295
       This cartere thakketh his hors upon the croupe,

And they bigonne to drawen and to stoupe.

"Heyt! Now," quod he, "ther Jhesu Crist yow blesse,

And al his handwerk, bothe moore and lesse!

That was wel twight, myn owene lyard boy.
300
I pray God save thee, and Seinte Loy!

Now is my cart out of the slow, pardee!"

       "Lo, brother," quod the feend, "what tolde I thee?

Heere may ye se, myn owene deere brother,

The carl spak oo thing, but he thoghte another.
305
Lat us go forth abouten oure viage;

Heere wynne I nothyng upon cariage."

       Whan that they coomen somwhat out of towne,

This somonour to his brother gan to rowne:

"Brother," quod he, "heere woneth an old rebekke,
310
That hadde almoost as lief to lese hire nekke

As for to yeve a peny of hir good.

I wole han twelf pens, though that she be wood,

Or I wol sompne hire unto oure office;

And yet, God woot, of hire knowe I no vice.
315
But for thou kanst nat, as in this contree,

Wynne thy cost, taak heer ensample of me."

       This somonour clappeth at the wydwes gate.

"Com out," quod he, "thou olde virytrate!

I trowe thou hast som frere or preest with thee."
320
       "Who clappeth?" seyde this wyf, "benedicitee!

God save you, sire, what is youre sweete wille?"

       "I have, quod he, "of somonce here a bille;

Up peyne of cursyng, looke that thou be

To-morn bifore the erchedeknes knee,
325
T'answere to the court of certeyn thynges."

       "Now, lord," quod she, "Crist Jhesu, kyng of kynges,

So wisly helpe me, as I ne may.

I have been syk, and that ful many a day.

I may nat go so fer," quod she, "ne ryde,
330
But I be deed, so priketh it in my syde.

May I nat axe a libel, sire somonour,

And answere there by my procuratour

To swich thyng as men wole opposen me?"

       "Yis", quod this somonour, "pay anon - lat se -
335
Twelf pens to me, and I wol thee acquite.

I shal no profit han therby but lite;

My maister hath the profit, and nat I.

Com of, and lat me ryden hastily;

Yif me twelf pens, I may no lenger tarye."
340
       "Twelf pens!" quod she, "now, lady Seinte Marie

So wisly help me out of care and synne,

This wyde world thogh that I sholde wynne,

Ne have I nat twelf pens withinne myn hoold.

Ye knowen wel that I am povre and oold;
345
Kithe youre almesse on me povre wrecche."

       "Nay thanne," quod he, "the foule feend me fecche

If I th'excuse, though thou shul be spilt!"

       "Allas!" quod she, "God woot, I have no gilt."

       "Pay me," quod he, "or by the swete Seinte Anne,
350
As I wol bere awey thy newe panne

For dette which thou owest me of old.

Whan that thou madest thyn housbonde cokewold,

I payde at hoom for thy correccioun."

       "Thou lixt!" quod she, "by my savacioun,
355
Ne was I nevere er now, wydwe ne wyf,

Somoned unto youre court in al my lyf;

Ne nevere I nas but of my body trewe!

Unto the devel blak and rough of hewe

Yeve I thy body and my panne also!"
360
       And whan the devel herde hire cursen so

Upon hir knees, he seyde in this manere,

"Now, Mabely, myn owene mooder deere,

Is this youre wyl in ernest that ye seye?"

       "The devel," quod she, "so fecche hym er he deye,
365
And panne and al, but he wol hym repente!"

       "Nay, olde stot, that is nat myn entente,

Quod this somonour, "for to repente me

For any thyng that I have had of thee.

I wolde I hadde thy smok and every clooth!"
370
       "Now, brother," quod the devel, "be nat wrooth;

Thy body and this panne been myne by right.

Thou shalt with me to helle yet to-nyght,

Where thou shalt knowen of oure privetee

Moore than a maister of dyvynytee."
375
And with that word this foule feend hym hente;

Body and soule he with the devel wente

Where as that somonours han hir heritage.

And God, that maked after his ymage

Mankynde, save and gyde us, alle and some,
380
And leve thise somonours goode men bicome!

       Lordynges, I koude han toold yow, quod this Frere,

Hadde I had leyser for this Somonour heere,

After the text of Crist, Poul, and John,

And of oure othere doctours many oon,
385
Swiche peynes that youre hertes myghte agryse,

Al be it so no tonge may it devyse,

Thogh that I myghte a thousand wynter telle

The peynes of thilke cursed hous of helle.

But for to kepe us fro that cursed place,
390
Waketh, and preyeth Jhesu for his grace

So kepe us from the temptour Sathanas.

Herketh this word! Beth war, as in this cas:

"The leoun sit in his awayt alway

To sle the innocent, if that he may."
395
Disposeth ay youre hertes to withstonde

The feend, that yow wolde make thral and bonde.

He may nat tempte yow over youre myght,

For Crist wol be youre champion and knyght.

And prayeth that thise somonours hem repente
400
Of hir mysdedes, er that the feend hem hente!
