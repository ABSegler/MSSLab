This yongeste, which that wente unto the toun,

Ful ofte in herte he rolleth up and doun

The beautee of thise floryns newe and brighte.

"O lorde," quod he, "if so were that I myghte

Have al this tresor to my-self allone,

Ther is no man that lyveth under the trone

Of God, that sholde lyve so murye as I."

And atte laste the feend, oure enemy,

Putte in his thought that he sholde poyson beye,

With which he myghte sleen hise felawes tweye;

For-why, the feend foond hym in swich lyvynge

That he hadde leve hem to sorwe brynge.

For this was outrely his fulle entente,

To sleen hem bothe, and nevere to repente.

And forth he gooth, no lenger wolde he tarie,

Into the toun unto a pothecarie

And preyde hym that he hym wolde selle

Som poysoun, that he myghte hise rattes quelle;

And eek ther was a polcat in his hawe,

That, as he seyde, hise capouns hadde yslawe;

And fayn he wolde wreke hym, if he myghte,

On vermyn that destroyed hym by nyghte.

       The pothecarie answerde, "And thou shalt have

A thyng, that al so God my soule save,

In al this world ther is no creature

That eten or dronken hath of this confiture

Noght but the montance of a corn of whete,

That he ne shal his lif anon forlete;

Ye, sterve he shal, and that in lasse while

Than thou wolt goon a paas nat but a mile,

This poysoun is so strong and violent."

       This cursed man hath in his hond yhent

This poysoun in a box, and sith he ran

Into the nexte strete unto a man,

And borwed of hym large botels thre;

And in the two his poyson poured he;

The thridde he kepte clene for his owene drynke.

For al the nyght he shoop hym for to swynke

In cariynge of the gold out of that place.

And whan this riotour, with sory grace,

Hadde filed with wyn his grete botels thre,

To hise felawes agayn repaireth he.

       What nedeth it to sermone of it moore?

For right as they hadde cast his deeth bifoore,

Right so they han him slayn, and that anon.

And whan that this was doon, thus spak that oon:

"Now lat us sitte and drynke, and make us merie,

And afterward we wol his body berie."

And with that word it happed hym, par cas,

To take the botel ther the poysoun was,

And drank, and yaf his felawe drynke also,

For which anon they storven bothe two.

       But certes, I suppose that Avycen

Wroot nevere in no canoun, ne in no fen,

Mo wonder signes of empoisonyng

Than hadde thise wrecches two, er hir endyng.

Thus ended been thise homycides two,

And eek the false empoysoner also.

       O cursed synne ful of cursednesse!

O traytours homycide, O wikkednesse!

O glotonye, luxurie, and hasardrye!

Thou blasphemour of Crist, with vileynye

And othes grete, of usage and of pride,

Allas, mankynde, how may it bitide

That to thy Creatour which that the wroghte,

And with His precious herte-blood thee boghte,

Thou art so fals and so unkynde, allas!

       Now, goode men, God foryeve yow youre trespas,

And ware yow fro the synne of avarice;

Myn hooly pardoun may yow alle warice,

So that ye offre nobles or sterlynges,

Or elles silver broches, spoones, rynges;

Boweth youre heed under this hooly bulle!

Com up, ye wyves, offreth of youre wolle!

Youre names I entre heer in my rolle anon,

Into the blisse of hevene shul ye gon.

I yow assoille by myn heigh power,

Yow that wol offre, as clene and eek as cleer

As ye were born. - And lo, sires, thus I preche.

And Jesu Crist, that is oure soules leche,

So graunte yow his pardoun to receyve,

For that is best, I wol yow nat deceyve.

       But sires, o word forgat I in my tale:

I have relikes and pardoun in my male,

As faire as any man in Engelond,

Whiche were me yeven by the popes hond.

If any of yow wole of devocioun

Offren, and han myn absolucioun,

Com forth anon, and kneleth heere adoun,

And mekely receyveth my pardoun;

Or elles taketh pardoun as ye wende,

Al newe and fressh at every miles ende,

So that ye offren alwey, newe and newe,

Nobles or pens, whiche that be goode and trewe.

It is an honour to everich that is heer

That ye mowe have a suffisant pardoneer

T'assoille yow in contree as ye ryde,

For aventures whiche that may bityde.

Paraventure ther may fallen oon or two

Doun of his hors, and breke his nekke atwo.

Look, which a seuretee is it to yow alle

That I am in youre felaweship yfalle,

That may assoille yow, bothe moore and lasse,

Whan that the soule shal fro the body passe.

I rede that oure Hoost heere shal bigynne,

For he is moost envoluped in synne.

Com forth, sire Hoost, and offre first anon,

And thou shalt kisse my relikes everychon,

Ye, for a grote! unbokele anon thy purs.'

       "Nay, nay," quod he, "thanne have I Cristes curs!

Lat be," quod he, "it shal nat be, so theech,

Thou woldest make me kisse thyn olde breech,

And swere it were a relyk of a seint,

Though it were with thy fundement depeint.

But by the croys which that Seint Eleyne fond,

I wolde I hadde thy coillons in myn hond

In stide of relikes or of seintuarie.

Lat kutte hem of, I wol thee helpe hem carie;

They shul be shryned in an hogges toord."

       This Pardoner answerde nat a word;

So wrooth he was, no word ne wolde he seye.

       "Now," quod oure Hoost, "I wol no lenger pleye

With thee, ne with noon oother angry man."

But right anon the worthy Knyght bigan,

Whan that he saugh that al the peple lough,

"Namoore of this, for it is right ynough.

Sir Pardoner, be glad and myrie of cheere;

And ye, sir Hoost, that been to me so deere,

I prey yow, that ye kisse the pardoner;

And Pardoner, I prey thee, drawe thee neer,

And, as we diden lat us laughe and pley."

Anon they kiste, and ryden forth hir weye.
