	Ther nys but fables and lesynges;
	But men may some sweven[es] sen
	Whiche hardely that false ne ben,
5	But afterward ben apparaunt.
	This may I drawe to warraunt
	An authour that hight Macrobes,
	That halt nat dremes false ne lees,
	But undoth us the avysioun
10	That whilom mette kyng Cipioun.
	And whoso saith or weneth it be
	A jape, or elles nycete,
	To wene that dremes after falle,
	Let whoso lyste a fol me calle.
15	For this trowe I, and say for me,
	That dremes signifiaunce be
	Of good and harm to many wightes
	That dremen in her slep a-nyghtes
	Ful many thynges covertly
20	That fallen after al openly.
	Within my twenty yer of age,
	Whan that Love taketh his cariage
	Of yonge folk, I wente soone
	To bedde, as I was wont to done,
25	And faste I slepte; and in slepyng
	Me mette such a swevenyng
	That lyked me wonders wel.
	But in that sweven is never a del
	That it nys afterward befalle,
30	Ryght as this drem wol tel us alle.
