i hate hym that my vices telleth me  and so doo mo god woot of us than i  this made hym with me wood al outrely  i nolde noght forbere hym in no cas         now wol i seye yow sooth by seint thomas  why that i rente out of his book a leef  for which he smoot me so that i was deef         he hadde a book that gladly nyght and day  for his desport he wolde rede alway  he cleped it valerie and

woot mercurie is desolat  in pisces wher venus is exaltat  and venus falleth ther mercurie is reysed  therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed  the clerk whan he is oold and may noght do  of venus werkes worth his olde sho  thanne sit he doun and writ in his dotage  that wommen kan nat kepe hir mariage          but now to purpos why i tolde thee  that i was beten for a book pardee  upon a nyght
